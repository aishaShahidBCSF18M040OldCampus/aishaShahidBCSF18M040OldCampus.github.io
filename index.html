<h2 class="head">What’s a version control system?</h2>
<div>
<p class="vcs">A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As the project evolves, teams can run tests, fix bugs, and contribute new code with the confidence that any version can be recovered at any time. Developers can review project history to find out:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Which changes were made?</li>
<li>Who made the changes?</li>
<li>When were the changes made?</li>
<br>
</ul></p>

<h2 class="head">What is GitHub?</h2>

<p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. <br>It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.
GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git.

<h2 class="head">What’s a repository?</h2>
<div class="sub-div3">
<p class="repo">A repository, or Git project, encompasses the entire collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with each file’s revision history. The file history appears as snapshots in time called commits, and the commits exist as a linked-list relationship, and can be organized into multiple lines of development called branches. Because Git is a DVCS, repositories are self-contained units and anyone who owns a copy of the repository can access the entire codebase and its history. Using the command line or other ease-of-use interfaces, a git repository also allows for:
 <ul><li>interaction with the history</li>
 <li> cloning</li> <li>creating branches</li>
 <li>committing</li>
 <li>merging</li>
 <li> comparing changes across versions of code</li>
 </p>

<h2 class="head">Create a Repository</h2>
