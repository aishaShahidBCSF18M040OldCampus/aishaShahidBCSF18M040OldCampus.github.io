<h2 class="head">What’s a version control system?</h2>
<div>
<p class="vcs">A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As the project evolves, teams can run tests, fix bugs, and contribute new code with the confidence that any version can be recovered at any time. Developers can review project history to find out:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Which changes were made?</li>
<li>Who made the changes?</li>
<li>When were the changes made?</li>
<br>
</ul></p>

<h2 class="head">What is GitHub?</h2>
<div class="sub-div2">

<p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. <br>It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.
GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git.

<h2 class="head">What’s a repository?</h2>
<div class="sub-div3">
<p class="repo">A repository, or Git project, encompasses the entire collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with each file’s revision history. The file history appears as snapshots in time called commits, and the commits exist as a linked-list relationship, and can be organized into multiple lines of development called branches. Because Git is a DVCS, repositories are self-contained units and anyone who owns a copy of the repository can access the entire codebase and its history. Using the command line or other ease-of-use interfaces, a git repository also allows for:
 <ul><li>interaction with the history</li>
 <li> cloning</li> <li>creating branches</li>
 <li>committing</li>
 <li>merging</li>
 <li> comparing changes across versions of code</li>
 </p>
</div>
<h2 class="head">Create a Repository</h2>
<div class="sub-div4">
<p class="create_repo">To create a new repository : <br>
<ul>
<li>In the upper right corner, next to your identicon, click  and then select New repository.</li>
<li>Name your repository &nbsp;<span style="background-color:gray;color:white"> &nbsp; VCS_Tuotorial</span></li>
<li>Write a short description (Optional) </li>
<li>Select Initialize this repository with a README (Optional)</li>
<li>Click &nbsp;<span style="background-color:gray;color:white"> &nbsp;create repository button</span></li>
</ul>

<h1 class="head">SETUP</h1>

<p>set a name that is identifiable for credit when review version history</p>
<p><span style="background-color:	#D3D3D3;font-weight: 700;"><b>git config --global user.name “[firstname lastname]”</b></span></p>
<p>set an email address that will be associated with each history marker</p>
<p><span style="background-color:#D3D3D3;font-weight: 700;"><b>git config --global user.email “[valid-email]”</b></span></p>
<p>set automatic command line coloring for Git for easy reviewing</p>
<p><span style="background-color:	#D3D3D3;font-weight: 700;"><b>git config --global color.ui auto</b></span></p>

<div>
<h2 class="g">git init </h2></li>
<p>git init initialize an existing directory as a Git repository.
git init initializes a brand new Git repository and begins tracking an existing directory. It adds a hidden subfolder within the existing directory that houses the internal data structure required for version control.
</p>

<br>
<h2 class="g">git add </h2></li>

<p>git add stages a change. Git tracks changes to a developer’s codebase, but it’s necessary to stage and take a snapshot of the changes to include them in the project’s history. This command performs staging, the first part of that two-step process. Any changes that are staged will become a part of the next snapshot and a part of the project’s history. Staging and committing separately gives developers complete control over the history of their project without changing how they code and work.</p>
